 * 
 * All DNA is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as A, C, G, and
 * T, for example: "ACGAATTCCG". When studying DNA, it is sometimes useful to
 * identify repeated sequences within the DNA.
 * 
 * Write a function to find all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that
 * occur more than once in a DNA molecule.
 * 
 * 
 * For example,
 * 
 * Given s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT",
 * 
 * Return:
 * ["AAAAACCCCC", "CCCCCAAAAA"].
