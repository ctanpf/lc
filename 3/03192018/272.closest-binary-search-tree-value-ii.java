 * 
 * Given a non-empty binary search tree and a target value, find k values in
 * the BST that are closest to the target.
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * Given target value is a floating point.
 * You may assume k is always valid, that is: k â‰¤ total nodes.
 * You are guaranteed to have only one unique set of k values in the BST that
 * are closest to the target.
 * 
 * Follow up:
 * Assume that the BST is balanced, could you solve it in less than O(n)
 * runtime (where n = total nodes)?
